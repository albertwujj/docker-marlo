# BROKEN - container runs but cannot exec??


# docker-reinforcement-learning

Reinforcement learning environment for [marLo](https://github.com/crowdAI/marLo), a Reinforcement Learning environment that is more widely useful than the single competition it was used in. 

Modified version of ikeyasu's container with U.S. localization and '0-1' cpu. The error message when building told me to switch it from '0-2' to '0-1'. Just follow the error messages when you are building. Requires a lot of memory, I had to use cloud compute.

For use as-is see the [Docker repo](https://cloud.docker.com/u/albertwujj/repository/docker/albertwujj/dmarlo)

## Quickstart
cd into repo and 'make build'
